            I am a web developer and in the Fullstack JavaScrip program at Thinkful.  I enjoy coding because it allows me the opportunity to solve problems and help others to see their ideas become working products and solutions. Before starting the journey to become a developer I was on the edges of discipline working both with reverse proxy technology and modifying clients existing Javascript for marketing and analytics.  I love the idea of being able to fully understand the process from beginning to end.  This allows me to not only to edit and maintain code but to build new and innovative projects as well.

            When I’m not coding or working in technology, I’m frequently researching projects with my coding group.  Or training in one of my movement-related passions.  I teach Indonesian Martial Arts and ADD also known as Parkour.  A few years ago I did stunt work for a movie, “The Lotus”, and I was on “American Ninja Warrior”.   From time to time some of the alumni get together for training and events.  It is surprising how many athletes from the show also work in the technology fields.
